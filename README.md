Game name: Ghosts in the Castle
Background info: I chose this subject for my game because I volunteer as a historical docent as well as a paranormal docent at Preston castle. It was built in 1890 as a boy's reform school and was used for the same purpose until 1960. It is said to be one of the most haunted places in California. All of the photos that I used in this game are of the actual place! I wanted to demonstrate what happens in a typical night of paranormal investigating at the castle, using this choose-your-own-adventure game to give you a small taste of the fun that we have when we investigate.

Instructions: Just read the story and interact with the buttons provided. The game will guide you to the win. If you don't like the way it's headed, there is a reset button at each stage you can use to go back to the beginning and try again. 
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Next steps: I'd like to continue the story in chapters so that all of the castle is explored. I would like to use more interesting fonts and colors so that it looks less basic. I would also like to use either animations or videos as well as add sounds to make the game more immersive.
